# Protein-Protein-Interaction-Graph-Heuristic
The program implements a heuristic algorithm to detect protein complexes from large interaction networks. More simply stating the program detectes clusters (cliques) of variable density and size from graphs which are representative of protein protein interaction data of Ecoli. The Ecoli dataset is included.
