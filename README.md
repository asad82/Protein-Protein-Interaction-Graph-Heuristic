# Protein-Protein-Interaction-Graph-Heuristic
The program implements a heuristic solution to detect protein complexes from large interaction networks. More simply stating the program detects clusters (cliques) of variable density and size from graphs which are representative of protein protein interaction data of Ecoli. The Ecoli dataset is included. However the program and the heuristic is generic enough to work with any kind of complicated graphs to reveal relationships between vertices that otherwise are difficult to seperate. 

The time complexity of this heuristic is N^3 as compared to N! of Brute Force Attack. 

To use the program first load/read the graph (sample Ecoli graphs included) using read button (R), then display the graph using graph button (G), then run the program/heuristic using heuristic (H) button. Finally display the identified clusters/cliques using Display button (D). Using can use the Plus and Minus button to zoom in and out of the view at any time.
